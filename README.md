# grunt-init-gruntplugin

> Create a gruntplugin module with [grunt-init][], including [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Mocha tests](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com) and [Bump](https://github.com/vojtajina/grunt-bump).
> This is based on the default [gruntplugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-gruntplugin) from [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com).

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/`
directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that
directory, as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/weareinteractive/grunt-init-gruntplugin.git ~/.grunt-init/grunt-plugin
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow
the prompts.

```
$ grunt-init grunt-plugin
```

*Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be
sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing
files.*
